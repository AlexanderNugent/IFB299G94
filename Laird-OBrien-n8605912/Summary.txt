The 5 Artefacts in this directory, show the work that I Laird O'Brien have contributed 
to this release. This summary will include the names, a brief overview, and the reason
why each Artefact was chosen.

Artefact Names:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1: Story Cards Powerpoint
2: Team Awareness & Communication
3: Github Demonstration
4: How to use Github
5: NUnit Tests Examples


Artefacts Overview & Why they were Chosen:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1: This Artefact is quite self-explanatory as the group brainstormed stories for the 
project and I took these, modified, added, deleted and arranged them in the correct format
for the assesment. I then created the acceptance criteria for all of the stories. This 
Artefact was chosen simply because the quality of my work may be assessed easily in this
instance.

2: I noticed that on the day before the release was due, that only one other person from 
the group had created a folder in the github directory to put their personal portfolio in.
I realised that they were probably having troubles understanding how to use it, as it took
me a couple of hours to work it out. I took it upon myself to reach out, communicate, and 
try to help solve their problems so that they may complete it on time. I believe that 
looking out for your team, and trying to help them when possible is very valuable in any
group project, and that is why this Artefact was included.

3: I decided to hold a meeting to help the other members of my team having trouble getting
their heads around github, because of the lack of understanding I discovered while 
observing and communicating in Artefact 2.

4: Because there were many commands for Github that may easily be forgotten after my 
demonstration to the team in Artefact 3, I decided to make an easy to read 'cheat sheet'
for future reference, for when any of my team members need to use Github. This provides 
my team with an easier method of dealing with the git repository and is why I chose this
as one of the examples of my contribution.

5: Considering I have been waiting for a new computer to arrive (Arrived Mon 14th Sep) I
have not contributed much to the C# application we are devloping to interact with the 
MySQL server. Due to this I decided to make some example test cases for the group, shown
in Artefact 5. Note: Ongoing from this point, I will be more hands on with the C#
application development, and this will be evident in future sprints/documentation.
